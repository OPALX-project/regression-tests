This test was checked with the linear matrix optics code, Trace3D. Trace3D is
an interactive graphical program and a screen shot of the short beam line for
this test is included in this directory.

Trace3D uses the following units:

Length:      	 	   mm
Emittance (transverse):    mm-mrad
Emittance (longitudinal):  degress-keV

Trace3D uses and diplays the unnormalized emittance. To convert the transverse
emittance that Trace3D diplays to OPAL values multiply them by:

14.66 x 10^-6

The longitudinal emittance is in degrees-keV, where the degrees refer to the
reference RF frequency, which is 700 MHz in this case. To convert the
longitudinal emittance in Trace3D to the OPAL units, multiply by:

2.278 x 10^-6
