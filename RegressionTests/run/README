Arguments
=========

As for now there are three flags:

--build 

updates and tries to build the sources in ../../opal and ../../classic

--user

should be used when the regression test is run by a user (not cron job). In this
case the script will not send emails and also does not copy the xml results to
the web directory. Additionally the script will be more verbose.  
Note: After submitting a regression test to the batch system the script will
check **every 60 seconds** if the job has finished.

--tests

specifies which regression tests are run, e.g. 

    --tests=BC1-1,RingCyclotron

runs only the BC1-1 and RingCyclotron regression tests (matching on directory 
name).

--run-local 

Without sge installed, use the --run-local switch and copy the regression-test-name.sge to 
regression-test-name.local. Edit the regression-test.local such that it only containes:

mpirun -np 4 $OPAL_EXE_PATH/opal ....
